🧬 Why Use StegoFy?

Unlike basic encryption, steganography makes data invisible by hiding it in plain sight. This tool makes it easier to protect information from prying eyes while maintaining the look and feel of a regular image.

Whether you’re a student, cybersecurity enthusiast, or a secret agent wannabe, StegoFy provides a thrilling, functional, and secure way to communicate covertly.
